# diply
Diply Proof Of Concept Site

Hey Diply Team

When initializing the project please use the following command:

npm run start

By default the site should load on http://localhost:8080

The javascript files can be found in the path diply/src/client/js

Thank you for affording me the opportunity to take this test.
