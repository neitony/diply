Diply Proof Of Concept Site

Hey Diply Team

When initializing the project please take the following steps:

1. Run npm install to retrieve dependencies

2. Run npm run start to launch the project


By default the site should load on http://localhost:8080 after compiling

The javascript files can be found in the path diply/src/client/js

Thank you for affording me the opportunity to take this test.
